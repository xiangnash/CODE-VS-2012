Utility tools for offline algorithms of CODE VS:
    directAns.out:
	direct answers to CODE VS client
    restoremap.out:
	restore the orignal challenges of CODE VS


== Direct answer your solutions to CODE VS client ==
1. Copy your solutions(in CODE VS client) to ../data/output.txt and ../data/input.txt
input.txt: 
output.txt:
map.txt:

2. Generate the answer to answer.h
./writeAns.out < ../data/map.txt  > ./answer.h 

3. Recompile and get a executable solution:
g++ directAns.cpp -o directAns.out

4. directAns.out could be upload to CODE VS client.



== Restore the map data ==
./restoremap.out < ../data/input.txt > ../data/map.txt

output.txt: challenge data in OUTPUT block of CODE VS client which is refer to the stdin stream
input.txt:  solution data in INPUT block of CODE VS client which is refer to the stdout stream

map.txt: The restored orignal map
