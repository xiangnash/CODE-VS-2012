Genetic Algorithm for the Tower Defence Challenge

Genetic.cpp:
	implementation of a naive genetic algorithm(simple generate 1/16 state of a position)

TwoPhaseGenetic.cpp:
	Step 1: generate the all the positions of tower and check the validity;
	Step 2: generate the tower type and calculate the answer.
